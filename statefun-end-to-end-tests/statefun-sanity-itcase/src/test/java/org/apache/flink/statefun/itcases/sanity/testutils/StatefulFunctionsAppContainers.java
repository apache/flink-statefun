/**
 * A JUnit {@link org.junit.rules.TestRule} that setups a containerized Stateful Functions
 * application using <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">Testcontainers</a>. This allows
 * composing end-to-end tests for Stateful Functions applications easier, by managing the
 * containerized application as an external test resource whose lifecycle is integrated with the
 * JUnit test framework.
 *
 * <h2>Example usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyITCase {
 *
 *     {@code @Rule}
 *     public StatefulFunctionsAppContainers myApp =
 *         new StatefulFunctionsAppContainers("app-name", 3);
 *
 *     {@code @Test}
 *     public void runTest() {
 *         // the containers for the app, including master and workers, will already be running
 *         // before the test is run; implement your test logic against the app
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In most cases you'd also need to start an additional system for the test, for example starting
 * a container that runs Kafka from which the application depends on as an ingress or egress. The
 * following demonstrates adding a Kafka container to the setup:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyKafkaITCase {
 *
 *     {@code @Rule}
 *     public KafkaContainer kafka = new KafkaContainer();
 *
 *     {@code @Rule}
 *     public StatefulFunctionsAppContainers myApp =
 *         new StatefulFunctionsAppContainers("app-name", 3)
 *             .dependsOn(kafka);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Application master and worker containers will always be started after containers that are
 * added using {@link #dependsOn(GenericContainer)} have started. Moreover, containers being
 * depended on will also be setup such that they share the same network with the master and workers,
 * so that they can freely communicate with each other.
 *
 * <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
 *
 * <p>Since Testcontainers uses Docker, it is required that you have Docker installed for this test
 * rule to work.
 *
 * <p>When building the Docker image for the Stateful Functions application under test, the
 * following files are added to the build context:
 *
 * <uL>
 *   <li>The {@code Dockerfile} found at path {@code /Dockerfile} in the classpath. This is required
 *       to be present. A simple way is to add the Dockerfile to the test resources directory. This
 *       will be added to the root of the Docker image build context.
 *   <li>The {@code flink-conf.yaml} found at path {@code /flink-conf.yaml} in the classpath, if
 *       any. You can also add this to the test resources directory. This will be added to the root
 *       of the Docker image build context.
 *   <li>All built artifacts under the generated {@code target} folder for the project module that
 *       the test resides in. This is required to be present, so this entails that the tests can
 *       only be ran after artifacts are built. The built artifacts are added to the root of the
 *       Docker image build context.
 * </uL>
