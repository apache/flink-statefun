/**
 * A {@link StatefulFunctionModule} is the entry point for adding to a Stateful Functions
 * application the core building block primitives, i.e. {@link IngressSpec}s, {@link EgressSpec}s,
 * {@link Router}s, and {@link StatefulFunction}s.
 *
 * <h2>Extensibility of a Stateful Functions application</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Stateful Functions application is built up of ingresses, egresses, routers, and stateful
 * functions that are added to the application by multiple different {@link
 * StatefulFunctionModule}s. This allows different parts of the application to be contributed by
 * different modules; for example, one module may provide ingresses and egresses, while other
 * modules may individually contribute specific parts of the application as stateful functions.
 *
 * <p>The extensibility is achieved by leveraging the <a
 * href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html#the-serviceloader-class">Java
 * Service Loader</a>. In this context, each module is essentially a service provider.
 *
 * <h2>Registering a {@code StatefulFunctionModule}</h2>
 *
 * <p>In order for an application to discover a given module, likewise to how the Java Service
 * Loader works, a UTF-8 encoded provider configuration file needs to be stored in the {@code
 * MEGA-INF/services} directory of the module's containing JAR file. The name of the file should be
 * {@code org.apache.flink.statefun.sdk.spi.StatefulFunctionModule}, i.e. the fully qualified name
 * of the {@link StatefulFunctionModule} class. Each line in the file should be the fully qualified
 * class name of a module in that JAR that you want to register for the Stateful Functions
 * application. The configuration file may also be automatically generated using Google's <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service">AutoService</a> tool.
 *
 * <p>Finally, to allow the Stateful Functions runtime to discover the registered modules, the JAR
 * files containing the modules and provider configuration files should be added to a
 * system-specific class path directory, {@code /opt/statefun/modules/}.
 *
 * <p>For a simple demonstration, you can consult the {@code statefun-greeter-example} example.
