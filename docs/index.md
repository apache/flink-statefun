**Stateful Functions** is an open source framework that reduces the complexity of building and orchestrating distributed stateful applications at scale.
It brings together the benefits of stream processing with Apache Flink® and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) to provide a powerful abstraction for the next generation of event-driven architectures.

There are many ways to get started with Stateful Functions.
Which one is the best for you depends on your goals and prior experience.
Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.

## Learn By Doing

If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our code [walkthrough]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/python_walkthrough.html).
It provides a step by step introduction to the API and guides you through real applications.

## Learn Concepts Step By Step

If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to [main concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/application-building-blocks.html).
It will walk you through all the API's and concepts to build advanced stateful systems.


## Start A New Project

The [project setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/project-setup.html) instructions show you how to create a project for a new Stateful Functions application in just a few steps.
