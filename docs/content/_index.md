# Stateful Functions Documentation

Stateful Functions is an API that simplifies the building of **distributed stateful applications** with a runtime built for **serverless architectures**. It brings together the benefits of stateful stream processing - the processing of large datasets with low latency and bounded resource constraints - along with a runtime for modeling stateful entities that supports location transparency, concurrency, scaling, and resiliency.

{{< img src="/fig/concepts/arch_overview.svg" alt="Stateful Functions" width="50%" >}}

It is designed to work with modern architectures, like cloud-native deployments and popular event-driven FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda and KNative, and to provide out-of-the-box consistent state and messaging while preserving the serverless experience and elasticity of these platforms.

Stateful Functions is developed under the umbrella of [Apache Flink](flink.apache.org)

## Learn By Doing

If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our code [walkthrough]({{< ref "docs/getting-started/python_walkthrough" >}}). 
It provides a step by step introduction to the API and guides you through real applications.

## Learn Concepts Step By Step

If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main [concepts]({{< ref "docs/concepts/application-building-blocks" >}}).
It will walk you through all the APIâ€™s and concepts to build advanced stateful systems.

## Start A New Project 

The [project setup]({{< ref "docs/getting-started/project-setup" >}}) instructions show you how to create a project for a new Stateful Functions application in just a few steps.
