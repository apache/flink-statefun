# I/O Module

Stateful Functions' I/O modules allow functions to receive and send messages to external systems.
Based on the concept of Ingress (input) and Egress (output) points, and built on top of the Apache FlinkÂ® connector ecosystem, I/O modules enable functions to interact with the outside world through the style of message passing.

Commonly used I/O modules are bundled into the runtime by default and can be configured direclty via the applications [module configuration]({{< ref "docs/deployment/module" >}}). 
Additionally, custom connectors for other systems can be [plugged in]({{< ref "docs/io-module/flink-connectors" >}}) to the runtime.

Keep in mind that to use one of these connectors in an application, additional third party components are usually required, e.g. servers for the data stores or message queues.

## Ingress

An Ingress is an input point where data is consumed from an external system and forwarded to zero or more functions.
It is defined via an ``IngressIdentifier`` and an ``IngressSpec``.

An ingress identifier, similar to a function type, uniquely identifies an ingress by specifying its input type, a namespace, and a name.

The spec defines the details of how to connect to the external system, which is specific to each individual I/O module. Each identifier-spec pair is bound to the system inside an stateful function module.
```yaml
version: "3.0"

module:
  meta:
    type: remote
  spec:
    ingresses:
      - ingress:
        meta:
          id: example/user-ingress
          type: # ingress type
        spec: # ingress specific configurations
```

## Router

A router is a stateless operator that takes each record from an ingress and routes it to zero or more functions.
Routers are bound to the system via a stateful function module, and unlike other components, an ingress may have any number of routers.

Routers are defined by a list of function types.
The ``id`` component of the address is pulled from the key associated with each record in its underlying source implementation.
```yaml
targets:
    - example-namespace/my-function-1
    - example-namespace/my-function-2
```

## Egress

Egress is the opposite of ingress; it is a point that takes messages and writes them to external systems.
Each egress is defined using two components, an ``EgressIdentifier`` and an ``EgressSpec``.

An egress identifier uniquely identifies an egress based on a namespace, name, and producing type.
An egress spec defines the details of how to connect to the external system, the details are specific to each individual I/O module.
Each identifier-spec pair is  bound to the system inside a Stateful Functions module.

```yaml
version: "3.0"

module:
  meta:
    type: remote
  spec:
    egresses:
      - egress:
        meta:
          id: example/user-egress
          type: # egress type
        spec: # egress specific configurations
```
