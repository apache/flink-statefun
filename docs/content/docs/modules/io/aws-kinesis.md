# AWS Kinesis


Stateful Functions offers an AWS Kinesis I/O Module for reading from and writing to Kinesis streams.
It is based on Apache Flink's [Kinesis connector](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.10/dev/connectors/kinesis.html).
Kinesis is configured in the [module specification]({{< ref "docs/modules/overview" >}}) of your application.


## Kinesis Ingress Spec

A Kinesis ingress defines an input point that reads records from one or more streams.

{{< tabs "8951ef0a-cdd4-40d1-bda8-dec1299aaf42" >}}
{{< tab "v1 (latest)" >}}
```yaml
kind: io.statefun.kinesis.v1/ingress
spec:
  id: com.example/users
  awsRegion:
    type: specific
    id: eu-west-1
  startupPosition:
    type: latest
  streams:
    - stream: user-stream
      valueType: com.example/User
      targets:
        - com.example.fn/greeter
  clientConfigProperties:
    - SocketTimeout: 9999
    - MaxConnections: 15
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Please refer to the Kinesis [client configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html) documentation for the full list of available properties.
Note that configuration passed using named methods will have higher precedence and overwrite their respective settings in the provided properties.

### Startup Position

The ingress allows configuring the startup position to be one of the following:

#### Latest (default)

Start consuming from the latest position, i.e. head of the stream shards.

```yaml
startupPosition:
  type: latest
```

#### Earliest

Start consuming from the earliest position possible.

```yaml
startupPosition:
  type: earliest
```

#### Date

Starts from offsets that have an ingestion time larger than or equal to a specified date.

```yaml
startupPosition:
  type: date
  date: 2020-02-01 04:15:00.00 Z
```

## Kinesis Egress Spec

A Kinesis egress defines an input point where functions can write out records to one or more streams.

{{< tabs "8951ef0a-cdd4-40d1-bda8-dec1299aaf41" >}}
{{< tab "v1 (latest)" >}}
```yaml
kind: io.statefun.kinesis.v1/egress
spec:
  id: com.example/out
  awsRegion:
    type: specific
    id: eu-west-1
  awsCredentials:
    type: default
  maxOutstandingRecords: 9999
  clientConfigProperties:
    - ThreadingModel: POOLED
    - ThreadPoolSize: 10
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Please refer to the Kinesis [producer default configuration properties](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/blob/master/java/amazon-kinesis-producer-sample/default_config.properties) documentation for the full list of available properties.

## AWS Region

Both the Kinesis ingress and egress can be configured to a specific AWS region.

#### Default Provider Chain (default)

Consults AWS's default provider chain to determine the AWS region.

```yaml
awsCredentials:
  type: default
```

#### Specific

Specifies an AWS region using the region's unique id.

```yaml
awsCredentials:
  type: specific
  id: us-west-1
```

#### Custom Endpoint

Connects to an AWS region through a non-standard AWS service endpoint.
This is typically used only for development and testing purposes.

```yaml
awsCredentials:
  type: custom-endpoint
  endpoint: https://localhost:4567
  id: us-west-1
```

## AWS Credentials

Both the Kinesis ingress and egress can be configured using standard AWS credential providers.

#### Default Provider Chain (default)

Consults AWSâ€™s default provider chain to determine the AWS credentials.

```yaml
awsCredentials:
  type: default
```

#### Basic

Specifies the AWS credentials directly with provided access key ID and secret access key strings.

```yaml
awsCredentials:
  type: basic
  accessKeyId: access-key-id
  secretAccessKey: secret-access-key
```

#### Profile

Specifies the AWS credentials using an AWS configuration profile, along with the profile's configuration path.

```yaml
awsCredentials:
  type: basic
  profileName: profile-name
  profilePath: /path/to/profile/config
```

### Writing To Kinesis

Functions write directly to Kinesis from their SDK context.
See SDK specific documentation for more details.
