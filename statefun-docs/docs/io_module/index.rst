Stateful Functions' I/O modules allow functions to receive and send messages to external systems.
Based on the concept of Ingress (input) and Egress (output) points, and built on top of the {flink} connector ecosystem, I/O modules enable functions to interact with the outside world through the style of message passing.

.. _ingress:

Ingress
^^^^^^^^

An Ingress is an input point where data is consumed from an external system and forwarded to zero or more functions.
An ``IngressIdentifier`` and an ``IngressSpec`` define it.

An ingress identifier, similar to a function type, uniquely identifies an ingress by specifying its input type, a namespace, and a name.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/java/org/apache/flink/statefun/docs/io/ingress/Identifiers.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

The spec defines the details of how to connect to the external system, which is specific to each individual I/O module.
Each identifier-spec pair is bound to the system inside an stateful function module.

    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

Router
""""""

A router is a stateless operator that takes each record from an ingress and routes it to zero or more functions.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/java/org/apache/flink/statefun/docs/io/ingress/UserRouter.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

Routers are bound to the system via a stateful function module.
Unlike other components, an ingress may have any number of routers.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/java/org/apache/flink/statefun/docs/io/ingress/ModuleWithRouter.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

.. _egress:

Egress
^^^^^^

Egress is the opposite of ingress; it is a point that takes messages and writes them to external systems.
Each egress is defined using two components, an ``EgressIdentifier`` and an ``EgressSpec``.

An egress identifier uniquely identifies an egress based on a namespace, name, and producing type.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/java/org/apache/flink/statefun/docs/io/egress/Identifiers.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

An egress spec defines the details of how to connect to the external system, the details are specific to each individual I/O module.
Each identifier-spec pair are bound to the system inside a stateful function module.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/java/org/apache/flink/statefun/docs/io/egress/ModuleWithEgress.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

Stateful functions may then message an egress the same way they message another function, passing the egress identifier as function type.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/java/org/apache/flink/statefun/docs/io/egress/FnOutputting.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

I/O modules leverage `Javaâ€™s Service Provider Interfaces (SPI) <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html>`_ for discovery.
This means that every JAR should contain a file ``org.apache.flink.statefun.sdk.spi.StatefulFunctionModule`` in the ``META_INF/services`` resource directory that lists all available modules that it provides.
