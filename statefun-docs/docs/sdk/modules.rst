Modules

Stateful Function applications are composed of one or more ``Modules``.
A module is a bundle of functions that are loaded by the runtime and available to be messaged.
Functions from all loaded modules are multiplexed and free to message each other arbitrarily.

Stateful Functions supports two types of modules: Embedded and Remote.

.. _embedded_module:

Embedded Module
===============

Embedded modules are co-located with, and embedded within, the {flink} runtime.

This module type only supports JVM based languages and are defined by implementing the ``StatefulFunctionModule`` interface.
Embedded modules offer a single configuration method where stateful functions are bound to the system based on their :ref:`function type <address>`.
Runtime configurations are available through the ``globalConfiguration``, which is the union of all configurations in the applications ``flink-conf.yaml`` under the prefix ``statefun.module.global-config`` and any command line arguments passed in the form ``--key value``.

    :language: java
    :lines: 18-

Embedded modules leverage `Javaâ€™s Service Provider Interfaces (SPI) <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html>`_ for discovery.
This means that every JAR should contain a file ``org.apache.flink.statefun.sdk.spi.StatefulFunctionModule`` in the ``META_INF/services`` resource directory that lists all available modules that it provides.

.. code-block:: yaml

    org.apache.flink.statefun.docs.BasicFunctionModule

.. _remote_module:

Remote Module
=============

Remote modules are run as external processes from the {flink} runtime; in the same container, as a sidecar, or other external location.

This module type can support any number of language SDK's.
Remote modules are registered with the system via ``YAML`` configuration files.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/main/resources/module.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 16-

Remote module definitions eagerly register each function type, the endpoint under which the function is available, along with all states for a particular function.
