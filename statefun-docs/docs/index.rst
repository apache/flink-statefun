Lightweight, Stateful Applications at Scale
###########################################

**Stateful Functions** is an open source framework that reduces the complexity of building and orchestrating distributed stateful applications at scale. It brings together the benefits of stream processing with Apache FlinkÂ® and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) to provide a powerful abstraction for the next generation of event-driven architectures.
