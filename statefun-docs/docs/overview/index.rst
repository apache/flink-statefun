Overview
########

**Stateful Functions** is a framework for building and orchestrating distributed stateful applications at scale that aims to solve some of the most significant operational challenges for developers: consistent state management, reliable interaction between distributed services and resource management.

Architecture Overview
#####################

The framework is based on :ref:`functions with persistent state <stateful_functions>` that can share a pool of resources and interact arbitrarily with strong consistency guarantees. **Stateful Functions** uses a state-of-the-art runtime built on `Apache Flink <https://flink.apache.org/>`_ for distributed coordination, communication and state management.

.. topic:: Stateful Functions API
   
 The API is based on, well, stateful functions: small snippets of functionality that encapsulate business logic, somewhat similar to `actors <https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/>`_. These functions exist as virtual instances — typically, one per entity in the application (for example, per user or stock item) — and are distributed across shards, making applications **scalable out-of-the-box**. Each function has persistent user-defined state in local variables and can message other functions (including itself!). This model makes **computing with state natural and uncomplicated**.

.. topic:: Stream Processing Runtime

 The runtime that powers **Stateful Functions** is based on stream processing with Apache Flink. State is kept in the stream processing engine, co-located with the computation, giving you fast and consistent state access. **State durability and fault tolerance** build on Flink’s robust `distributed snapshots model <https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/internals/stream_checkpointing.html>`_.

.. topic:: Messaging Model

 In **Stateful Functions** applications, everything is inherently strongly consistent: state modifications and messaging are integrated to create the effect of **consistent state and reliable messaging** within all interacting functions. Care about consistency needs to be taken only when interacting with the "outside world”. Event Ingresses and Egresses — optionally with transactional semantics — support interaction with the “outside world” via event streams.

.. topic:: Consistency Model

 Interactions flow between functions as event streams, in the style of message passing. Apache Flink’s snapshot-based fault tolerance model was extended to support cyclic data flow graphs while ensuring **exactly-once messaging guarantees** (yay!). As a result, you can have functions messaging each other arbitrarily, efficiently and reliably.

**Stateful Functions** splits compute and storage differently to the classical two-tier architecture: one ephemeral state/compute tier and a simple persistent blob storage tier. This approach **eliminates the need to provision additional databases, key-value stores or message brokers** and effectively offloads application state management from the shoulders of developers.

Technology Space
################

**Stateful Functions** is heavily inspired by multiple existing technologies for stateless application development and orchestration. Other than Apache Flink, also Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) systems such as AWS Lambda and the `virtual stateful actor model <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Orleans-MSR-TR-2014-41.pdf>`_ from Microsoft Orleans served as inspiration for this project.

The framework is mostly implemented in Java and runs on the JVM. Extending the API to be cross-language compatible and support languages like Python, Go or NodeJS is part of the Roadmap.
